<p>Hey there! Welcome to my website. My name is Suleman Farooqi, there is a lot that I do throughout my free days but lately I've been occupied with school mostly.
<br>I'm graduating in December 2020 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and aiming to get myself a job as soon as I graduate.
<br> A few of my hobbies consist of 
<ul>
	<li>Photography</li>
	<li>Music Production</li>
	<li>Videography</li>
	<li>Track Racing</li>
	<li>Arduino Projects</li>
    <li>Again</li>
</ul>
<br>I will be adding more information on this website as time progresses. This also includes any projects that I'm working on.
<br>Creating a website for yourself is very helpful since it displays the goals that you have achieved, so it's a good way to
<br>keep records of what you're doing, share what you're doing with the world and also helps you in becoming better at writing
<br>your thoughts down. You can also recieve a good amount of feedback from people and that can help in linking you with others.
